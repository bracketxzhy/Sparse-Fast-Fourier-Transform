This repository contains the official implementation and research paper for the **ECE Analysis** course project at **Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute (SCUPI)**. Under the guidance of **Prof. Hao Qin**, this project investigates the mechanics, history, and efficiency of the Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) compared to traditional FFT methods.

## 📖 Abstract

The Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) is an advanced numerical algorithm designed to analyze signals with frequency-domain sparsity more efficiently than the traditional $O(N \log N)$ Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). [cite_start]This study involves a detailed mathematical analysis of SFFT mechanisms—including hashing, filtering, and frequency recovery[cite: 386]. [cite_start]Our research demonstrates that SFFT offers a significant decline in computational complexity for large, sparse datasets without compromising accuracy, making it ideal for applications in medical imaging and wireless communication[cite: 381, 403].

## ✨ Key Research Contributions

- [cite_start]**Mathematical Decomposition**: In-depth analysis of randomized sub-linear time algorithms and their evolution from MIT and Michigan groups[cite: 387, 388].
- [cite_start]**Deterministic SFT Analysis**: Evaluation of deterministic methods that guarantee correctness, moving beyond the inherent failure probabilities of randomized methods[cite: 389, 391].
- [cite_start]**Structured Sparsity Optimization**: Exploration of **Block/Cluster Sparsity** (contiguous blocks) and **Polynomially Generated Sparsity** (algebraic structures)[cite: 403, 404].
- **Complexity Comparison**:
  - [cite_start]**Unstructured Deterministic**: $O(n^2 \log^{O(1)} N)$[cite: 395].
  - [cite_start]**Prony-based Methods**: $O(n^3)$ for $n$-sparse signals[cite: 398].
  - **Proposed Structured SFT**: Achieves faster recovery by exploiting the algebraic structure of the frequency support.

## 🚀 Performance Insights

[cite_start]Our findings indicate that for structured frequency supports, leveraging the structural prior dramatically reduces sampling and computational burdens[cite: 405].
